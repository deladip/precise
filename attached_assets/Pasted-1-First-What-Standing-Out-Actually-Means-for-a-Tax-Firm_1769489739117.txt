1️⃣ First: What “Standing Out” Actually Means for a Tax Firm

Most tax websites fail because they:

List services like a phone book

Look generic and cold

Don’t explain why someone should trust them

Make booking harder than it should be

Standing out ≠ flashy design
Standing out = clarity + authority + ease

Your advantage:

ERO + CAA + COA (huge trust signals)

Full business lifecycle services (not just taxes)

One-stop shop (individual + business)

We will build the site around those strengths.

2️⃣ Simple Website Structure (Keep It Tight)

You only need 5 pages.

1. Home
2. Services
3. Business Solutions
4. About / Credentials
5. Contact / Book Consultation

That’s it.

3️⃣ Branding Direction for PRECISE METHOD

Your name is strong. Use it intentionally.

Positioning Statement (Core Message)

Hero Section (Above the Fold)

Headline (clear and confident):

Individual & Business Tax Preparation

6️⃣ Business Solutions Page (This Is a Differentiator)

This page is where you stand out.

Explain that most firms handle one piece.
You handle everything.

7️⃣ About / Credentials Page (Trust Builder)

Do NOT write a life story.

Structure it like this:

9️⃣ How You REALLY Stand Out (This Is Key)
1️⃣ Speak Human, Not IRS

Most tax sites sound like legal documents.
Yours should sound calm, clear, and reassuring.

2️⃣ Emphasize Year-Round Support

Say this everywhere:

“We’re not just here during tax season.”

3️⃣ One-Stop Messaging

Repeat this theme:

One firm. One point of contact. Total compliance.

4️⃣ Transparency

Add a section like:

What to Expect When You Work With Us

People love predictability.

🔟 Simple Tech Stack (No Overkill)
Recommended Setup:

Website: WordPress or Wix

Booking: Calendly or Google Appointment Scheduling

Email: Your domain email (info@precisemethod.com
)

Forms: Built-in or Formspree

Hosting: Simple shared hosting is fine
